# Open Decisions
- Final RLS per table (draft next)
- In-app only vs. Web Push for MVP
- Exact interests/cities vocab and storage design
- Billing: Razorpay integration (monthly postpaid; â‚¹20k threshold freeze); show available credit

---
Next: Draft ERD and initial SQL schema; define RLS policies; enumerate endpoints; estimate monthly costs under target load.
