# PO Validation — SynC (MVP Planning Artifacts)

Date: 2025-08-11  
Owner: PO  
Status: Passed with notes

## Checklist
- PRD present: docs/prd.md — OK
- Front-End Spec present: docs/front-end-spec.md — OK
- Architecture present: docs/fullstack-architecture.md — OK
- DB schema present: docs/supabase_schema.sql — OK
- RLS policies present: docs/rls_policies.sql — OK
- Notifications policy present: docs/notifications-policy.md — OK
- Billing model present (dummy mode): docs/billing-model.md — OK
- DB apply guide present: docs/db-apply.md — OK
- Seeds present: configs/cities.json, configs/interests.json — OK

## Notes / Risks
- Owner role via JWT claim 'owner' accepted now; future flexibility scaffolded (`platform_admins`, `business_members`).
- Dummy billing mode set in `platform_config`; no live Razorpay required in MVP.
- City-only matching for MVP; lat/lng can be added later.
- Runtime tunables (throttles/caps/carousel) seeded in `platform_config`.

## Next Steps
- Shard PRD and Architecture for IDE development
- Draft OpenAPI skeleton, test plan/CI, seeds/mocks, owner config UI spec
