- Problem: Physical stores struggle to instantly update and stay connected with customers outside shopping moments, reducing footfall compared to e‑commerce which excels at instant offers/notifications.
- Solution: A unified platform for discovery, engagement, and rewards, with social features and gamified coupon sharing, digital storefronts, targeted promotions, analytics, and a “Driver” program to stimulate organic growth and retention.
