# 4. In Scope / Out of Scope (MVP)
### 4.1 MVP Scope (Must‑have)
- Consumers: Supabase Auth; profile; dashboard (nav/search/city/avatar/notifications/wishlist/ads/coupon wallet/contacts sidebar); wishlist; favorites; feedback (recommend/don’t); responsive web (React, Vite, Tailwind)
- Social: Find friends; friend requests accept/decline; activity feed; coupon share/accept/decline/discard with lifecycle tracking and daily caps
- Coupons: Discovery and in‑store redemption; wallet updates; trending offers and savings advisor (P2 important)
- Businesses: Supabase Auth; onboarding (category/subcategory/target areas/demographics/avg ticket seasons); storefronts (branding, location, offers, contact, trending products suggestions); business dashboard (offers, analytics, recommendations, identify “Drivers”)
- Platform Owner: Dashboard; revenue tracking (coupon generation, banners, push notifications, search ads)
- Billing: Dummy mode for MVP (no live Razorpay). Billing UI present; payments disabled until activation flag is set by owner.

### 4.2 Out of Scope for MVP (Deferred)
- In‑app chat in contacts sidebar; public coupon sharing (phase 2)
- AI agent features for wishlist events; video‑rich storefronts; user‑initiated events hosting
- Star ratings (use recommend/don’t); manual check‑ins (prefer GPS or coupon redemption triggered)
- KYC; mandatory mobile/WhatsApp OTP; multi‑city per user/business; detailed multi‑tier pricing
