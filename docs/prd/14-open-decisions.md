# 14. Open Decisions
1) Component add‑ons list (reactbits etc.)
2) Publish v1 JSONs for Indian Tier1/2/3 cities and 23 interest categories (frozen)
3) Realtime scale guardrails and queue thresholds
4) Driver scoring: owner‑controlled recalculation (ad‑hoc/scheduled); start with equal weights; weights configurable
5) Marketing policy for boosting vs. pausing/canceling offers (force majeure handling)
