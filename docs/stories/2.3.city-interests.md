# Story 2.3: City & Interests

## Status
Review

## Story
As a user, I want to select my city and interests so that the app can personalize offers and content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Protected page `/dashboard/profile/city-interests` to edit city and interests.
2. City is chosen from a predefined list (configs/cities.json); interests from multi-select (configs/interests.json).
3. On save, selections persist (MVP: localStorage) and are visible on reload.
4. Unset selections should prompt user to complete on first login.
5. Links back to Profile and Dashboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Route `/dashboard/profile/city-interests` (protected)
- [ ] Load cities/interests from `configs/*.json`
- [ ] Multi-select interests (â‰¥5 required for save)
- [ ] Persist to `localStorage.sync_profile` (MVP)
- [ ] (Future) Wire to backend API

## Dev Notes
- Use the same container styles as other profile pages for consistency.
- Validate at least 5 interests before enabling save.
