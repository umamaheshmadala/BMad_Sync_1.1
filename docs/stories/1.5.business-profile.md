# Story 1.5: Business Profile

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a business owner, I want to manage my business profile so that my storefront displays accurate branding and contact information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Protected page at `/business/portal/profile` under Business Portal.
2. Fields: Business Name, Address, Google Location (URL), Contact Phone, Contact Email, Open/Close toggle, Holidays (text), Logo URL.
3. Save persists locally (MVP) and shows confirmation; values load on revisit.
4. If not authenticated, redirect to `/auth/login?redirectTo=/business/portal/profile`.
5. Link back to Business Portal and Dashboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Route `/business/portal/profile` (protected)
- [ ] Profile edit form with labeled inputs and basic validation readiness
- [ ] Local persistence via `localStorage`
- [ ] Navigation links to Portal and Dashboard
- [ ] (Future) Wire to backend/Supabase table
- [ ] (Future) Unit tests for validation and serialization

## Dev Notes
- Stored under `localStorage.sync_business_profile` as JSON for MVP.
- Future integration can POST to an API and hydrate from server.
