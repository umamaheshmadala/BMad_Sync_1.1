# Story 2.2: Products Display

## Status
Done

## Story
As a user visiting a business storefront, I want to see a products grid so that I can quickly browse trending items.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Public storefront view page shows a grid of products (title, price, optional trending badge).
2. Business Portal has a protected Products page to manage the list (create/edit/delete), persisted locally for MVP.
3. Changes in Products page are reflected in the storefront view.
4. Navigation exists between Business Portal and Products page; public view is easily discoverable for testing.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Public storefront view route (read-only grid)
- [x] Protected Business Products route with CRUD (MVP: localStorage-backed)
- [x] Persist products in `localStorage.sync_products`
- [x] Link from Business Portal
- [ ] (Future) Wire to backend APIs

## Dev Notes
- For MVP, product shape: `{ id: string, title: string, price: number, trending?: boolean }`.
