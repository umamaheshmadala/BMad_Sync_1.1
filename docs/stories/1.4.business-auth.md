# Story 1.4: Business Auth

## Status
Done

## Story
As a business owner, I want to log in to a protected Business Portal so that I can manage my storefront and offers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Route `/business/portal` is protected by auth guard.
2. If authenticated, the portal loads a minimal shell (placeholder) with links to profile/offers/analytics.
3. If not authenticated, redirect to `/auth/login?redirectTo=/business/portal`.
4. Sign-out from anywhere returns to `/auth/login`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create `/business/portal` route (protected)
- [ ] Minimal portal shell page
- [ ] Link back to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Tests: guard behavior

## Dev Notes
- Future: role-based portal (business-specific features) using JWT claims
