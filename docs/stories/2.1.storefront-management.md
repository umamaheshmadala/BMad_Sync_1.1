# Story 2.1: Storefront Management

## Status
Done

## Story
As a business owner, I want to manage my storefront (content and status) so that customers see accurate branding and availability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Protected page at `/business/portal/storefront` to edit storefront details.
2. Fields: Description, Theme (select), Is Open (toggle), Banner Image URL.
3. Save persists locally (MVP) and shows confirmation; values load on revisit.
4. Link back to Business Portal and Dashboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Route `/business/portal/storefront` (protected)
- [ ] Form with labeled inputs and basic validation readiness
- [ ] Local persistence via `localStorage`
- [ ] Navigation links
- [ ] (Future) Wire to backend API for persistence

## Dev Notes
- Use `localStorage.sync_storefront` for MVP persistence.
- Theme options aligned with existing UI: `cosmic`, `daylight`, `ocean`.
