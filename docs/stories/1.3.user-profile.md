# Story 1.3: User Profile

## Status
Done

## Story
As a user, I want to manage my profile (name, preferred name, avatar, contact info) so that my account and UI reflect my identity and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Profile page is available from the dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard/profile`).
2. Form fields: name, preferred name, avatar URL (or upload later), contact email/phone.
3. On save, values persist for the session (local implementation acceptable for MVP; backend wiring can follow).
4. If logged out, navigating to the page redirects to `/auth/login`.
5. Basic validation and accessible error messages.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] UI
  - [ ] Create `/dashboard/profile` route (protected)
  - [ ] Build form with labeled inputs and inline validation
- [ ] Persistence
  - [ ] MVP: Save to localStorage; show success toast
  - [ ] Prepare integration points for future API/Supabase persistence
- [ ] UX
  - [ ] Provide a way back to the main dashboard
  - [ ] Show current saved values on load
- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Integration: route guard redirects unauthenticated users
  - [ ] (Optional) Unit: validation helpers

## Dev Notes
- Future: integrate with Supabase profile table or API endpoint
- Reuse common styles and i18n strings
