# Story 1.1: Repo Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
As a developer, I want a monorepo scaffold with web, API, and shared packages so that the team can build and test features end‑to‑end efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared` and root configs (`tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`).
2. Local dev scripts run: install, build, test for all packages.
3. Web opens and renders landing page; API health endpoint responds 200.
4. CI runs lint+test; README updated with setup instructions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize monorepo structure and workspace settings
  - [x] Root `package.json` scripts for install/build/test
  - [x] Configure TypeScript project references
- [x] Web app minimal page + dev server
- [x] API health/diagnostic route
- [x] Vitest setup + example test
- [x] CI workflow: lint/test
- [x] Update `README.md` getting started section

## Dev Notes
- Reference `docs/architecture/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` when available.
- Keep installs reproducible; prefer exact versions from `package-lock.json`.

### Testing
- Unit: example component/function test runs in CI.
- Integration: API health route tested.
- E2E (optional): basic smoke with `scripts/smoke.mjs`.
